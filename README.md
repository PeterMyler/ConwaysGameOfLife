# Conways Game of Life
This is my best effort at implementing an efficient "Conways Game of Life" program in Python with some extra functionalities such as: editing/drawing, pausing, fps limiting and extra modes.\
(I know Python is the last language I should've used for an "efficent" program, but hey. I love Python. So just let me be)

## Requirements
This project requires Pygame and Numpy to run
```
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```
